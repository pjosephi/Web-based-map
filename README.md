Project Milestone (Final)

We generated 2 files - index.html(which has the list of keywords) and
inventor.html (which is the list of inventors)

On clicking on any keyword in the index.html file you will be
directed to another html file titled keyword.html which 
contains all the application name(s), application number(s), and inventor(s)


Clicking on the inventors name will  direct you to the an html page titled inventorname.html and this page lists all the application the inventor is a part of 


Similarly, on clicking on any authors name  you will be directed to html file
titled - author.html, which contains  all patent application numbers and names for every patent application that the inventor is linked to.
